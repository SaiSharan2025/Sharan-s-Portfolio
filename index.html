    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
      I'm an aspiring engineer with a Bachelor of Technology degree in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Guru Nanak Institutions Technical Campus, Hyderabad (CGPA: 7.04, 2025). At Campus placement I have selected to a company as an Intren and I completed my Intrenship for 5 months at Frontier Energies.Then I got an exciting offer from Amazon as Transportation Representive.

        <h3>Automatic and Instantaneous Power Station Power Quality Monitoring using IOT Tech</h3>
        <center><img src="./Screenshot (2).png" alt="Project Pic" width="400px" /></center>
        <p>This project aims to develop a smart, real-time system for monitoring the power quality in power stations using Internet of Things (IoT) technology. The system continuously tracks critical electrical parameters such as voltage, current, frequency, power factor, and harmonic distortion to ensure optimal performance and early detection of anomalies.
          This data is processed and analyzed in real-time, allowing operators to monitor power quality metrics instantly through a user-friendly dashboard. Automated alerts are generated in case of deviations from standard thresholds, enabling quick corrective actions and minimizing downtime.

        <h3> A Transformerless Quadratic Buck- 
        Boost Converter with High Voltage Gain Ratio</h3>
        <center><img src="./Screenshot (3).png" alt="Project Pic" width="400px" /></center>
        <p>This project focuses on the design and implementation of a transformerless quadratic buck-boost converter that achieves a high voltage gain ratio while maintaining compact size and improved efficiency.The converter can operate efficiently across a wide input voltage range, making it suitable for applications such as renewable energy systems (like solar PV), electric vehicles, and portable power supplies.The project includes simulation, hardware implementation, and performance evaluation to validate the converter’s ability to deliver a high, stable output voltage with minimal losses and good dynamic response.
